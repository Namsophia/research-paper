# Prevalence of gestational diabetes in pregnant women


## Gestational diabetes


## Introduction
Gestational Diabetes (GD) is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy (Zawiejska et al., 2008).
GD is also defined as a glucose intolerance resulting in hyperglycaemia of variable severity with onset during pregnancy (Baz et al., 2016). The reported prevalence of GDM ranges from 1% to 14% of all pregnancies, depending on the population studied and the diagnostic tests employed (Kim et al., 2002). GD manifest during the third trimester although symptoms may start to be noticed as early as the end of the second trimester. In most cases, gestational diabetes will resolve after delivery, however the affected women are still at higher risks of developing type 2 Diabetes later in life (Dabelea et al., 2005; Deierlein et al., 2011). Gestational diabetes may lead to multiple maternal complications including antepartum haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and risk of future diabetes mellitus; and foetal and neonatal complications such as still birth, dystocia, spontaneous abortion, macrosomia, prematurity and respiratory distress syndrome and the risk of developing neonatal diabetes (Njete et al., 2018; Gabbe et al., 1997). Factors such as family history of diabetes, age above 25 years, having a body-mass-index of more than 25, weight gain during pregnancy, poor dietary habits during pregnancy, cigarette smoking and sedentary life style have been implicated with the development of gestational diabetes(Rich-Edwards et al., 1999; Larijani et al., 2003)


## Background
Over the past decade, it was well recognised that women with diabetes had poor outcomes for their pregnancies. Gestational diabetes was first identified in the 1950s as a transient maternal condition that affects foetal outcome negatively and that it abated after delivery.  A decade later, it was recognised that the degree of glucose intolerance during pregnancy was related to the risk of developing diabetes within a few years after the pregnancy. Currently, Gestational Diabetes as defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) is any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy.
Gestational Diabetes is a high blood sugar condition that some women acquire during pregnancy and it usually starts halfway through the pregnancy between the 24th and 28th week of pregnancy. Approximately 7% of all pregnancies are complicated by Gestational Diabetes, resulting in more than 200,000 worldwide cases annually and the prevalence may range from 1% to 14% of all pregnancies depending on the population studied and the diagnostic tests employed. During normal pregnancy, a progressive insulin resistance (IR) develops beginning around mid-pregnancy, and progresses during the third trimester (Catalano et al., 1991). Hormones and adipokines secreted from the placenta, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, human placental lactogen (hPL), and human placental growth hormone are possible causes of IR in pregnancy. In addition, increased oestrogen, progesterone, and cortisol during pregnancy contribute to a disruption of the glucose insulin balance (Barbour et al., 2007). To compensate for the peripheral IR during pregnancy, insulin secretion increases from a woman’s pancreas. The development of GD occurs when a woman’s pancreas does not secrete enough insulin to keep up with the metabolic stress of the IR. In addition, increased maternal adipose deposition, decreased exercise, and increased caloric intake contribute to this state of relative glucose intolerance. Whereas, Gestational diabetes(GD) is defined as hyperglycaemia that is first diagnosed during pregnancy and should be classified as  gestational diabetes (GD) (WHO, 2013). 


## The prevalence of gestational diabetes in women.
Gestational Diabetes is a public health problem that currently affects a large part of women in the reproductive age, precisely pregnant women and can have either short or long-term consequences for the fetus and the mother. Globally diabetes prevalence is increasing rapidly by 381 million in 2013 to 422 million in 2016 living with diabetes (Boka et al., 2019). The international diabetes federation (IDF) asserts that, globally, one in 7 births was diagnosed of GD in 2017. Approximately 7% of all pregnancies are complicated by GD, resulting in more than 200,000 worldwide cases annually and the prevalence may range from 1% to 14% of all pregnancies depending on the population studied and the diagnostic tests employed. Approximately between 3 and 10 percent of expectant mothers develop this condition (GD), making it one of the most common health problems of pregnancy (Baxi & Bansal, 2017). Worldwide, 7% of all pregnancies are complicated by diabetes and causes for maternal and prenatal morbidity and mortality (Boka et al., 2019).


## Conclusion
In conclusion, the findings of this study point out that the most affected age group was of 25-34 years, overweight and family history of diabetes were found to be risk factors of GD. Women with GD are more likely to deliver macrosomic babies or hypoglycaemic babies and may require surgical intervention in order to have normal deliveries. Based on the results and observations, the prevalence of GD is low and with early detection and treatment the complications associated with GD can be resolved as to promote healthy maternal and fetal life thereby reducing morbidity and mortality.
